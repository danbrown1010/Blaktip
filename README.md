# Blaktip
Future repo of Blaktip codebase
A serverless application used to monitor and manage marine livestock and enironmental instrumentation. The app showcases serverless authentication and authorization using the AWS platform.

The mobile front-end is built using the Expo framework and client libraries to call AWS services and mobile backend APIs. The backend APIs themselves are powered by AWS services. The backend APIs are built using a serverless architecture, which makes it easy to deploy updates, and it also means that there are no servers to operationally manage.

Blaktip is primarily developed and maintained by Dan Brown. The project code is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
